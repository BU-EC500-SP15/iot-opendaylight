#BROWSER HEATMAP
NodeJS scripts and attached views for Browser HeatMap.

##Requirements:
Almost all required modules are added already to the folder.
But, in case of missing node_module, one can type(without quotes):
	"npm install missing_module_name"
to install the required modules.

Modules Used:
HTTP, REQUEST : for forming HTTP GET,POST requests to get data on/off the ODL DataStore
SOCKET.IO     : for communication between server and view pages

##TO RUN the script:
You will need NodeJS(0.12.0 or later) to run this script

To check if you already have NodeJS installed, type in(without quotes):
		"node -v" 
It will return the version of your NodeJS, in case you don't have it installed:
One can download it following the steps below:

	Linux Users  : sudo apt-get install node
	MAC Users    : yum apt-get install node
	Windows Users: Download from - https://nodejs.org/download/

Type in this into your terminal(after the above installation completes)
cd HEATMAP
node heatmap.js

The console will tell you the port it is listening to(currently 8111)
With heatmap.js running in background,
Type in: 
	http://localhost:8111 in your Browser 

and voila! It works!

TROUBLESHOOTING:
* The ODL server is listening on IP(52.10.62.166) at karafPORT(8282).
* If you want to see just the app working, heatmap.js is running at IP:PORT(52.10.62.166:8111)
	go to : http://52.10.62.166:8111
* Check your IPs and Port twice! before running the script:
  IP        : 52.10.62.166  -- IP where ODL is running; in this case heatmap.js is running on the same IP as well(would be replaced with your IP/localhost)
  karafPORT : 8282	    -- PORT on IP where ODL is running
  PORT      : 8111	    -- PORT where server is running
