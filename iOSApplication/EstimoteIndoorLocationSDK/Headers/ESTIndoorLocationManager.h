/**
The `ESTIndoorLocationManager` class defines the interface for Estimote Indoor Location SDK. Use
this class to setup a new location and to obtain position inside the location.
Only one instance of this class should be created inside the application.

### Setting up a new location
 
In order to obtain precise position updates you need to prepare a physical location for Estimote Indoor Location.
The procedure consists of the following steps:

- Configuration of the beacons.
- Placing beacons.
- Mapping the physical location to an instance of `ESTLocation`.
 
Invoke `locationSetupControllerWithCompletion:` to obtain dedicated UIViewController guiding through this process.
Result of this procedure is a prepared physical location and an instance of ESTLocation that can be used for obtaining position updates.

 
### Obtaining position inside the location
 
Once you have instance of `ESTLocation` you can start obtaining position updates for that location.
First you need to set a `delegate` which will be receiving the updates and then start the manager for
the location. Note that only one location at a time is supported.
 
    indoorLocationManager.delegate = yourDelegate;
    [indoorLocationManager startIndoorLocation:yourLocation];

Do not forget to stop the manager if you are not using location updates any more.

    [indoorLocationManager stopIndoorLocation];
